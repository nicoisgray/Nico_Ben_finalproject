1. This project will be done by Nico Schiller and Ben Thompson. We can coordinate to work on it because we have each other's phone numbers and we live on the same floor in Grand Hall. We'll probably work on this project immediately after this class meets in the evening, at least once a week.
2. We will be using this dataset of all the games on the gaming platform Steam. Here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/steamgames?resource=download
3. Null hypothesis: For the dataset "Steam Games" there will be no difference between the number of recommendations per game in correlation to average time played per game. Alternative: For the dataset "Steam Games" there will be a difference in the number of recommendations per game in correlation to average time played per game.
4. We will be using linear regression because this is a question that cannot be displayed using binary outcomes. We'd also be supervised learning models because we want to make concrete predictions about how our variables correlate to each other.
