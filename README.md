# Nico_Ben_finalproject

This project was done by Nico Schiller and Ben Thompson for the final project in CSCI1070. We attempted to find a relationship between the average amount of time a game is played as compared to the reviews, recommendations, etc. using linear regression, logistic regression, and dimensionality reduction. The data set used was a catalog of every video game available on the Steam platform in 2022. We ran into multiple fatal errors in the process, including but not limited to: Computer crashing, VSCode crashing, VSCode freezing, size errors, errors in visualization that we could not find information on how to fix despite extensive googling, and general coding incompetence. There is some semblance of a project here. We did find a score of 0.79 when using Logistic Regression, and that was our highest score throughout the course of the project. Our logistic regression score with PCA dimensionality regression was 0.38. Our R2 score with Linear Regression was 0.03, and our Mean Absolute Error was 174.75.
